This is a collection of rage characters prepared as custom smileys for XMPP (and
other IM protocols that support it). I have scaled all characters to a height of
either 32 or 64 pixels, added alpha channel transparence, added light outlines for
dark backgrounds and reworked texts and other details in order to keep them
distinguishable when scaled down to that size.

If you are using Pidgin, you can install them by running the 'install.py' script.
